<h1>About Me</h1>
<p></p>I'm an enthusiastic Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE)

My passion for technology, particularly in the realm of electronics and communication, 
fuels my academic pursuits.</p>

   to grow both technically and intellectually. I enjoy delving into the intricacies 
   of circuit design, signal processing, and communication systems. Beyond academics,
    I'm also actively involved in Department association, AI and Robotics club, which 
    allows me to collaborate with like-minded peers and broaden
